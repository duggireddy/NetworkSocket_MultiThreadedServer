How can one connect the Multiple clients to one server?

- Open cmd window from the folder MultiThreadedServer for Server and each client 
- Run "py MultiThreadedServer" to run the server
- Run "py client1" it connect to the server and receive the #ISO 8601 datetime in string format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmmmmm) for every 5sec interval.
- To connect the multiple clients open another cmd window..... from the same folder and run "client2........." 
- I wrote the program to  disconnect the client after some time.
